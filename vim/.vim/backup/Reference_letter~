Letter of Recommendation for Attila Nagy

Dear

I have known Attila for three years in my capacity as Software Engineer at Nokia Siemens Networks Company. Attila worked for me on various projects and based on his work, I would describe him as a hard working person with result oriented focus endowed with very good communication skills. Furthermore, he proved his ability to work in a team effectively and eagerness to challenge himself in new situations.

Attila as an eminent member of our scrum team managed to come up frequently with innovative ideas regarding to both the developement process and socialization of the team. His focused mind and inquisitive nature enabled him to enhance the cumbersome validation process and stabilize our testing environmnet. He has shown capability of producing well structured code in C++ and various scripting languages such as Perl, Python and Bourne shell.

As you can tell, I hold Attila in a very high regard and therefore can highly recommend him for master programme which would tap the skills referenced above.

If I can be of any further assistance, or provide you with any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
Benedetto Fallica

Recommendation Letter for Attila Nagy

I am writing this reference at the request of Attila Nagy who is applying for master programme in embedded systems in Sweden.

I knew Attila for the last 3 semesters of his studies at Budapest TECH Polytechnical Institution as I tought him several courses, such as: programming, embedded systems and computer networks, and I was the supervisor of his thesis. Therefore, I have had the opportunity to observe his interaction in class and his devotion to project works. He showed high proactivity in teamwork, supportive attitude and excessive curiousity towards new technology. Moreover, he can manage his time well and work in group situations under strict deadlines. For instance, he finished his thesis one month before deadline. Therefore, I would rate Attila's performance in my class as superior which is reflected by the grades I gave.

Furthermore, he has shown openness to new places, peoples, cultures and customs, since he spent his sixth semester in Germany as an ERASMUS student. His communication skill developed during this period which was evident by his presentation of thesis and project works.

All in all, I consider him as an optimal candidate for master programme in embedded systems, but if you should need any additional information you can feel free to contact me anytime.

Sincerly,
Dr. Schuster György
