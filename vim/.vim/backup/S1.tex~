\section{Introduction}
This report presents two possible designs for a brake-by-wire system operating
in two different modes. The upcoming sections will discuss these designs in
details, provide models and analyses for each subsystem, show our
interpretation of these results, and, eventually, give a recommendation
regarding to the adequate usage of these designs. Figure~\ref{fig1} shows the
overall construction of the system.

It can be seen on the above picture, that the system consists of a central
unit, four wheel units and a pair of system buses. The brake pedal, which is
controlled by the driver, is connected to the central unit. The braking
intention is transmitted electronically from the brake pedal to the actuators
positioned at each wheel. When the pedal is pressed, the central unit
transmits this command to each wheel unit.  Safety is guaranteed by ensuring
that the central unit and the wheel units are using well-known fault-tolerant
techniques with optimal design. The system, therefore, implemented using
redundant components for computation, data communication and speed measurement
in the wheel units.  In addition, a closed-loop, anti-lock braking control
algorithm generated by a stability control program provide an optimized
performance for the system.

Further studies on the braking mechanisms show that, a brake-by-wire system by
removing the mechanical link between the pedals and brakes, includes lower cost
and weight, faster braking response, simpler integration with stability control
than in hydraulic system. By these benefits the brake-by-wire systems are
expected to replace the hydraulic braking systems in the near future.~\cite{booklet_tttech}
