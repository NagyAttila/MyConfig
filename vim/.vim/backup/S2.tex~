\section{Overview of the Candidate Architectures}
To devise such a system, there are two possible architectural solutions; both can
be considered as a completely functioning and correct construction. Since each
has its own benefits and drawbacks, this section is dedicated for the
clarification of these architectures for a better understanding of the later
sections.

But before diving deep into the description of these two architectures, we will
take a short look on each unit. As figure~\ref{fig1} shows, there are three kinds of unit in the system:

\begin{itemize}
  \item System Bus (SB),
  \item Central Unit (CU) and
  \item Wheel Unit (WU).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{System Bus} % (fold)
\label{par:System Bus}
Two separate, serial bus units provide communication between the
central unit and the wheel units. Since the system would fail without these
units, they have a vital role and, therefore, one from the two must operate
under any circumstances.
% paragraph System Bus (end)

\paragraph{Central Unit} % (fold)
\label{par:Central Unit}
There is only one central unit in the system connected to the
brake pedal. It processes the output of this pedal and sensors located in the
wheel units, provide optimization on the brake performance by a braking
control algorithm, and controls the wheel units via the system buses. Thus, its
fault-tolerance is highly important.
% paragraph Central Unit (end)

\paragraph{Wheel Units} % (fold)
\label{par:Wheel Units}
A brake-by-wire system contains four wheel units connected to the central unit
by the system bus. Each wheel unit contains two sensors, two computer modules,
four bus interfaces and one actuator. Figure~\ref{fig2} depicts one wheel unit with
its components.

\subsection{Architectures} % (fold)
\label{sub:Arthitectures Faul-tolerant point of view}
The major differences between these two architectures are the location of the
unit in which the anti-lock algorithm resides and the configuration of the
central unit.

\subsubsection{Centralized Architecture}
In one case, this algorithm runs in the central unit making it more complex
and, therefore, generates higher failure rate. This is called centralized
architecture. In this case, the central unit starts from a triplex
configuration which consists of three identical, fail-silent, active units. If
one of these units fails, then the configuration fails into the duplex state,
which has two active, fail-silent units. Both triplex and duplex configurations
operate in active redundancy meaning in case of error the erroneous unit is
shut down and stop generating more errors. However, there is a faint
possibility, stems from the 99\% coverage factor, for bypassing the fail-silent
functionality in duplex configuration and, even thought two units are up and
running, ending in a catastrophic failure.  Moreover, it must be highlighted
that the coverage factor is ideal in a triplex configuration.

\subsubsection{Distributed Architecture}
In the other case, the anti-lock algorithm is part of the wheel units' computer
module creating even higher failure rate than the central unit has in the
centralized architecture, since these modules are more effected by the shaking
and bouncing of the vehicle. This is the so-called distributed architecture.
Furthermore, in this architecture there are only two central units working in a
duplex configuration.

\subsection{Modes of Operation}
Finally, taking into consideration the whole system, it has two levels of
functionality:
\begin{itemize}
  \item full and
  \item degraded.
\end{itemize}

In both cases the central unit with one of the system buses must work properly.
The only difference between these two functionalities are the number of functioning
wheel units. While the full functionality requires all the four wheel units to
work properly, in case of degraded functionality the system can operate with 3 units from these 4.
