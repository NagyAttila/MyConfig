\section{Description of Models}
{In this section, we discuss all the models we used in our analyses of the
brake-by-wire system in both distributed and centralized architecture. During
these analyses the following methods were used to demonstrate the functionality
of the units:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Reliablility Block Diagrams,
  \item Markov Chain Modelling,
  \item Fault-Tree Analyses (FTA).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Wheel Unit Model}
On figure~\ref{fig2} can be seen the general block diagram of one wheel unit and its
corresponding markov chain model. As the figures implies, the two computer
modules process the signals from the sensors, control the actuator and
communicate with the central units through the bus interfaces. Regarding to the
architectures, as already mentioned in the previous section, the anti-lock
algorithm runs in the wheel units in case of distributed architecture
increasing the failure rate in the computer modules.  On the other hand, this
unit is functionality-independent, meaning it has no alternation between the
degraded and full functionality. Furthermore, the coverage factor is ideal for
these modules.

\subsection{Wheel Unit Subsystem Model}
/TODO:no figures below.../The figures below describe the whole wheel unit subsystem in the two possible
functionalities using fault-tree analysis. The number of working wheel units
determines the functionality in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Number of working WU = 4 $\Longrightarrow$ full functionality (Figure~\ref{fig4}),
  \item Number of working WU = 3 $\Longrightarrow$ degraded functionality (Figure~\ref{fig5}),
  \item Number of working WU $\leq$ 2 $\Longrightarrow$ system failure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Central Unit (CU)}
\subsubsection{Distributed Duplex Architecture}

In a duplex configuration there are two fail-silent computer modules operating
in active redundancy; therefore, any faulty module is shut down immediately
without causing error. In addition, since this configuration has a coverage
factor of 99\%, as the figure~\ref{markov} shows, it is possible to
occur a catastrophic failure even if these two modules are working properly.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=.5]{Fig6.pdf}
  \caption{Central Unit, duplex configuration }
  \label{fig6}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=.75]{pic5.JPG}
  \caption{Reliability block diagram for the Central Unit, duplex configuration}
  \label{fig7}
\end{figure}

In the markov model, at state A, both modules are up and running. From this
state, we go either to state B with 2$\lambda$ or to state C with
2$\lambda$(1-c) failure rate. In the former case, one computer module has
failed, and we only get results from the other module. Therefore, we can go
from state B to state C with only 1$\lambda$ failure rate. In the latter
case, all the two modules failed at once causing a catastrophic failure.  In
conclusion, this architecture can tolerate a maximum of only one failure.

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=5mm and 20mm]
      \node[state] (s2) {A};
      \node[state] (s3) [right= of s2] {B};
      \node[state] (s4) [right= of s3] {C};
      \draw [->,bend left=45] (s2) to node[above] {$c*2\lambda_{CU-CM} $} (s3);
      \draw [->,bend right=45] (s2) to node[above] {$(1-c)*2\lambda_{CU-CM}$} (s4);
      \draw [->,bend left=45] (s3) to node[above] {$\lambda_{CU-CM}$} (s4);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Markov chain model for the Central Unit, duplex configuration\label{markov}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Centralized Triplex Architecture}
The centralized architecture uses a triplex configuration, with three
fail-silent computer modules operating in active redundancy, where the errors
are masked through majority voting.  Any faulty module is immediately shut down
and the system reconfigures itself from a triplex to a duplex configuration.
From that point, the central unit works perfectly the same as it was described
at the duplex configuration part.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=.5]{Fig9.pdf}
  \caption{Central Unit, triplex configuration }
  \label{fig9}
\end{figure}

Comparing to the duplex configuration, there is an extra state in the markov
model, when all the three computer modules are operational with ideal coverage
factor. In case of a module failure, from this state we fail into the duplex
configuration.  Conclusively, through this additional state, this configuration
can tolerate one more failure than the duplex.\\

      \draw [->,bend right=45] (s2) to node[above] {$(1-c)*2\lambda_{CU-CM}$} (s4);
      \draw [->,bend left=45] (s3) to node[above] {$\lambda_{CU-CM}$} (s4);
