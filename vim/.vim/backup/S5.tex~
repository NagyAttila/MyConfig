\section{Discussion}
In this section, based on our interpretation of the results from the previous
section, we will highlight the pros and cons of the possible functionalities
and architectures with the limitations of their analyses.

Firstly, by comparing the two architectures, it can be seen that the
centralized has a better reliability and mean-time-to-failure rate in almost all the
cases. This comparison shows
\pgfmathsubtract{\rWUSScentFULL}{\rWUSSdistFULL}\pgfmathresult~ more
reliability in the wheel unit subsystem,
\pgfmathsubtract{\rCUSScent}{\rCUSSdist}\pgfmathresult~ in the central unit and
\pgfmathsubtract{\rENTIREcentFULL}{\rENTIREdistFULL}\pgfmathresult~ in the
entire system at full functionality. Similar trend is reflected in the
mean-time-to-failure; the wheel unit subsystem has a
\pgfmathsubtract{\mttfWUSScentFULL}{\mttfWUSSdistFULL}\pgfmathresult~ higher
MTTF, the entire full functioning system's is
\pgfmathsubtract{\mttfENTIREcentFULL}{\mttfENTIREdistFULL}\pgfmathresult~
higher, but the centralized design's central unit has
\pgfmathsubtract{\mttfCUSSdist}{\mttfCUSScent}\pgfmathresult~ year less
mean-time-to-failure.

Secondly, in the degraded functionality, the centralized architecture has even
more convincing results than it had at the full functionality. In the entire
system, this architecture showed
\pgfmathsubtract{\mttfENTIREcentDEGR}{\mttfENTIREdistDEGR}\pgfmathresult~ years
better mean-time-to-failure and had
\pgfmathsubtract{\rENTIREcentDEGR}{\rENTIREdistDEGR}\pgfmathresult~ greater
reliability; its wheel unit subsystem is
\pgfmathsubtract{\rWUSScentDEGR}{\rWUSSdistDEGR}\pgfmathresult~ more reliable
and has \pgfmathsubtract{\mttfWUSScentDEGR}{\mttfWUSSdistDEGR}\pgfmathresult~
years more mean-time-to-failure.

Thirdly, the reliability graphs also verify the statements above. For instance,
figure~\ref{entire} representing the entire system's reliability in 4 years
period clearly shows that the distributed architecture less reliable in both
functionalities. After 4 years the difference between the designs in degraded
functionality is more than 0.12 and almost 0.2 in full functionality. Moreover,
reliability of the systems in full functionality started to fall
immediately after the commissioning of the system, while it is quite static in the
first year of the degraded functionality. This can be explained by the number of
minimum active modules in the wheel unit subsystem. While the full
functionality requires all the 4 wheel units to be under operation, the degraded
can run with three if necessary.

Finally, since the reliability values simply indicate the probability of the
system to function correctly in a given time period under a set of operating
conditions, the distributed architecture can be termed as the unreliable
architecture when compared to the centralized architecture. In terms of
mean-time-to-failure, the wheel unit configured in the centralized architecture
is expected to operate for a longer period before the occurrence of a failure
than a distributed system configuration. It is important to note that the wheel
unit in the brake-by-wire system has a 37\% chance of functioning correctly at
an amount of time equal to the MTTF values for each of these
architectures~\cite{book_safety}. 

Potential advantages of the centralized architecture include reduced wheel unit
failures since the control algorithms for the wheel units are executed by the
central unit and lower implementation cost due to less hardware requirements.
Disadvantages include higher central unit failure rate than the distributed
architecture and complexity in designing the central unit because it requires
more memory and processing power than the distributed architecture.  Designing
such a complex central unit may be more costly.  The distributed architecture's
advantages include lower central unit failure rate and less central unit
complexity, which may be less costly than the centralized architecture.
Hence, higher cost of implementation and a higher failure probability for the
wheel units due to exposure to vibration, moisture and temperature cycling
which reduces system reliability. 

To summarize the properties of these two architecture, we can say:
\begin{itemize} 
  \item the centralized architecture 
  \begin{itemize} 
    \item is more reliable,
    \item has greater MTTF,
    \item but costs more;
  \end{itemize}

\item the distributed architecture
  \begin{itemize}
    \item is less reliable,
    \item has lower MTTF,
    \item but costs less.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
